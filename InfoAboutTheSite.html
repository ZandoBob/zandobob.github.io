            This is a very basic HTML and CSS site. I am poking my way through sorta-learning it, and mostly copy-pasting things I have figured out and modifying them as needed. 

            Everything being lowercase is just a visual experiment, I think it looks simpler that way. The goal of this site is simplicity, as I'm fed up with having to faff about on a million different platforms. Do let me know if it makes things harder to read. After years of yapping on various chat platforms and forums, I'm used to parsing english in lowercase, missing punctuation, horribly misspelled, or all of the above.
