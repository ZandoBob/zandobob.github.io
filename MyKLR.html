            This is my 2022 KLR650, purchased used with around 2700 miles on it. It's the "Adventure" trim and has ABS (Anti-lock Braking System). I typically run 50/50 dualsport tires, usually Kenda K270s. It's at around 21,000 miles currently.

            Mods it has so far:
            -> T-Rex Racing Upper crash bars
            -> T-Rex Racing center stand
            -> Tusk Billet footpegs
            -> Kawasaki lower crash bars
            -> Kawasaki aux lights
            -> Kawasaki USB port and 12v socket
            -> Tusk Pannier racks (I use Tusk large aluminum panniers on these, may get a set of soft bags in future)
            -> Tusk "barkbuster" type handguards

            Mods I'm in the process of adding:
            -> Cogent Moab rear shock + Fork DDCs and new Racetech springs
            -> Eastern Beaver ABS switch
            -> Camel ADV one-finger clutch kit (essentially a longer lever on the clutch shaft)
            -> Kawasaki heated grips
            -> JNS lowering footpeg mounts

            Repairs I have to make: 
            -> footpeg mounting nuts failed, have to drill them out and weld in new ones

            Mods I'll be removing:
            -> T-Rex Racing center stand - it pretty appreciably changes the maximum lean angle before things scrape, and bounces off of rocks and such.
